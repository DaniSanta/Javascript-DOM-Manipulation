# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects,in order to write a code that would append a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I Make sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and writed a JavaScript code that would listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote a JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
